</p><p align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>3.1. </b><u><b>Franchised Location.</b></u>



</p><p align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Franchisee is granted the right and franchise to own and operate one ROCKY MOUNTAIN
CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store at the address and location which shall be set forth in <u>Exhibit&nbsp;I</u>,
attached hereto (“<b>Franchised Location</b>”). The type of Store configuration shall also be set forth in

</p><p align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights that are hereby granted to the Franchisee are for the specific Franchised Location
and cannot be transferred to an alternative Franchised Location, or any other location, without the
prior written approval of the Franchisor. If the Franchisee has operated a ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE
FACTORY Store for not less than 12&nbsp;months and desires to relocate it to an alternative site, the
Franchisee must set forth its reasons for requesting the relocation in writing to the Franchisor,
along with a proposed new location. The Franchisor will have 30&nbsp;days from receipt of the
Franchisee’s written request to respond. If the Franchisor approves the relocation and the proposed
new location, and if the ownership of the Franchisee does not change in any respect from the
ownership of the Franchisee before the relocation, then the Franchisee may move its Store to the
new approved location, provided that the Franchisee signs the Franchisor’s then current form of
Franchise Agreement and opens the Store at the new location within 12&nbsp;months after the Store closes
at its former Franchised Location. In addition, the Franchisee will be required to pay a
nonrefundable design fee of $2,500 to the Franchisor for the Franchisor’s Store designers to design
the layout of the Franchisee’s new Store location. A similar design fee will also apply if the
Franchisee requests design assistance in remodeling its Store at any time during the term of this
Agreement. See <u>Section&nbsp;5.2</u> below. The Marks and Licensed Methods are licensed to the
Franchisee for the operation of the ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store only at the Franchised
Location; therefore, the Franchisee may not operate food carts, participate in food festivals or
offer any other type of off-site food services using the Marks and Licensed Methods without the
prior written consent of the Franchisor, in which case the Franchisor and the Franchisee shall
execute an addendum to this Agreement relating to the operation of “<b>Satellite Stores</b>” (if this
Agreement governs the operation of a traditional Store, any Satellite Store(s) shall be governed by
separate Franchise Agreements) or “<b>Temporary Stores</b>.”

Franchisor retains the rights, among others: (1)&nbsp;to use, and to license others to use, the Marks
and Licensed Methods for the operation of ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Stores, Kiosk Stores,
Satellite Stores and Temporary Stores, at any location other than at the Franchised Location; (2)
to use the Marks and Licensed Methods to identify services and products, promotional and marketing
efforts or related items, and to identify products and services similar to those which the
Franchisee will sell, but made available through alternative channels of distribution other than

forth in <u>Exhibit&nbsp;I</u> attached hereto, all of which is due and payable on the date the
Franchisee signs this Agreement. The Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that the initial franchise
fee represents payment for the initial grant of the rights to use the Marks and Licensed Methods,
that the Franchisor has earned the initial franchise fee upon receipt thereof and that the fee is
under no circumstances refundable to the Franchisee after it is paid, except as set forth in
<u>Section&nbsp;5.6</u> of this Agreement. If a transfer occurs, no initial franchise fee shall be due
at the time that the Franchisee transfers the Store to another party, but a transfer fee will apply
as set forth in <u>Section&nbsp;16.2</u> of this Agreement.

</p><p align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Franchisee shall obtain the Franchisor’s prior written approval before executing any lease
or purchase agreement for the Franchised Location. Any lease for the Franchised Location shall, at
the option of the Franchisor, contain provisions including: (1)&nbsp;allowing for assignment of the
lease to the Franchisor in the event that this Agreement is terminated or not renewed for any
reason; (2)&nbsp;giving the Franchisor the right to cure any default by the Franchisee under such lease;
and/or (3)&nbsp;providing the Franchisor with the right, exercisable upon and as a condition of the
approval of the Franchised Location, to execute the lease agreement or other document providing
entitlement to the use of the Franchised Location in its own name or jointly with the Franchisee as
lessee and, upon the exercise of such option, the Franchisor shall provide the Franchisee with the
right to use the premises as its sublessee, assignee, or other similar capacity upon the same terms
and conditions as obtained by the Franchisor. The Franchisor may choose to hire a third party
professional to negotiate the Franchisee’s lease and the Franchisee agrees to reimburse the
Franchisor for its actual costs associated with any such negotiation. The Franchisee shall deliver
a copy of the signed lease for the Franchised Location to the Franchisor within 15&nbsp;days of its
execution. The Franchisee acknowledges that approval of a lease for the Franchised Location by the
Franchisor does not constitute a recommendation, endorsement or guarantee by the Franchisor of the
suitability of the location or the lease and the Franchisee should take all steps necessary to
ascertain whether such location and lease are acceptable to the Franchisee.

MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Stores are an integral part of the Franchisor’s proprietary Licensed

within the time specified in such lease, sublease, other agreement or other Franchise
Agreement. Provided, however, so long as financing from the United States Small Business

the Franchisor upon a default by the Franchisee under the terms of this Agreement, the
Franchisor reserves the right to collect amounts due from the Franchisee to any third party
and to pay the third party directly. If the Franchisor collects any such amounts, the
Franchisor may, in its sole discretion, charge the Franchisee an administrative fee to
reimburse the Franchisor for its costs of collecting and paying such amounts. Any
administrative fee charged would not exceed 15% of the total amount of money collected.
Additionally, in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Franchisor prior to its
expiration as set forth in <u>Sections&nbsp;18.1</u> or <u>18.2</u> above, the Franchisee
acknowledges and agrees that in addition to all other available remedies, the Franchisor
shall have the right to recover lost future Royalties during any period in which the
Franchisee fails to pay such Royalties through and including the remainder of the then
current term of this Agreement.



</p><p align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <u><b>Liquidated Damages</b></u>. Franchisee acknowledges that, if there is any act in
violation of <u>Sections&nbsp;18.1</u> or <u>18.2</u> of this Agreement, it will be impossible
to determine with specificity the damage to Franchisor. Therefore, for purposes of this
Agreement, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each day that Franchisee is in
violation of <u>Sections&nbsp;18.1</u> or <u>18.2</u> of this Agreement, Franchisee shall pay
to Franchisor the sum of $500.

option to purchase some or all of the assets of the ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store, which
may include, at the Franchisor’s option, all of the Franchisee’s interest, if any, in and to the
real estate upon which the ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store is located, and all buildings and
other improvements thereon, including leasehold interests, at fair market value, less any amount
apportioned to the goodwill of the ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store which is attributable to
the Franchisor’s Marks and Licensed Methods, and less any amounts owed to the Franchisor by the

than the effective date of termination, in the case of termination, or at least 90&nbsp;days
prior to the expiration of the term of the franchise, in the case of non-renewal. Such
notice shall include a description of the assets the Franchisor will purchase.

value for the assets of the ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store, then the fair market
value shall be determined by an independent third party appraisal. The Franchisor and the
Franchisee shall each select one independent, qualified appraiser, and the two so selected
shall select a third appraiser, all three to determine the fair market value of the ROCKY
MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store. The purchase price shall be the median of the fair market
values as determined by the three appraisers.

additional documentation as may be necessary and appropriate to effectuate such recording.

take place no later than 60&nbsp;days after the termination or nonrenewal date. The Franchisor will pay
the purchase price in full at the closing, or, at its option, in five equal consecutive monthly
installments with interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The Franchisee must sign all documents of
assignment and transfer as are reasonably necessary for purchase of the ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE
FACTORY Store by the Franchisor.

assets of the Franchisee’s ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store as set forth above, the
Franchisee will be free to keep or to sell, after such termination or expiration, to any third
party, all of the assets of its ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store; provided, however, that all
appearances of the Marks are first removed in a manner approved in writing by the Franchisor. The
Franchisor will only be obligated to purchase any assets of the ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY

the development and operation of ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store located at

In
accordance with <u>Section&nbsp;5.5</u> of the Franchise Agreement, Franchisee certifies to Franchisor
that the Franchised Location complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes,
codes, rules, regulations and standards including, but not limited to, the federal Americans with
Disabilities Act and any similar state or local laws. The Franchisee has obtained all such permits
and certifications as may be required for the lawful construction and operation of the ROCKY
MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE FACTORY Store, together with all certifications from government authorities
having jurisdiction over the site that all requirements for construction and operation have been
met, including without limitation, zoning, access, sign, health, safety requirements, building and
other required construction permits, licenses to do business, sales tax permits, health and
sanitation permits and ratings and fire clearances. The Franchisee has obtained all customary
contractors’ sworn statements and partial and final lien waivers for construction, remodeling,
decorating and installation of equipment at the Franchised Location. The Franchisee acknowledges
that it is an independent contractor and that the requirement of this certification does not
constitute ownership, control, leasing or operation of the Store or the Franchised Location by the
Franchisor, but rather provides notice to Franchisor that the Franchisee has complied with all
applicable laws. The Franchisee asserts that Franchisor may justifiably rely on the information
contained in this certificate.

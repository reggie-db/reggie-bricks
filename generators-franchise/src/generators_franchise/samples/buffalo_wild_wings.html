per annum or the maximum contract rate of interest permitted by governing law, whichever is less, from and after the date of accrual. In addition to interest charges on late Continuing Fee and Advertising Fee payments, you must pay to us a service
charge of $150 for each delinquent report or payment that you owe to us under this Agreement. A payment is delinquent for any of the following reasons: (i) we do not receive the payment on or before the date due; or (ii) there are insufficient funds
in your bank account to collect the total payment by a transfer of funds on or after the date due. The service charge is not interest or a penalty, it is only to compensate us for increased administrative and management costs due to late payment.

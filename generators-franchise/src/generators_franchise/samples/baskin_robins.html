<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">2.0 As a result of the expenditure of time, effort and money, we have acquired experience and skill in the continued development of the Baskin-Robbins
System (the “System”), which involves the conceptualization, design, specification, development, operation, marketing, franchising and licensing of restaurants and associated concepts for the sale of proprietary and non-proprietary food
and beverage products. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:0px;"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">2.1 In connection with the System, we own or have the right to license certain intellectual

Baskin-Robbins<font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="1"><sup style="vertical-align:baseline; position:relative; bottom:.8ex">®</sup></font>, and other indicia of origin (collectively, the “Proprietary Marks”), as well as
patents and copyrights. The Proprietary Marks include trademarks on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. From time to time we may supplement or modify the list of Proprietary Marks associated with the System.
</font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">2.2 As franchisor, we have the right to establish “Standards” for various aspects of the System that include the location, physical
characteristics and quality of operating systems of restaurants and other concepts; the products that are sold; the qualifications of suppliers; the qualifications, organization and training of franchisees and their personnel; the timely marketing
of products and our brand, including execution of marketing windows; and all other things affecting the experience of consumers who patronize our System. We make those Standards available to you in our Manuals and in other forms of communication,
which we may update from time to time. Complete uniformity may not be possible or practical throughout the System, and we may from time to time vary Standards as we deem necessary or desirable for the System. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">2.3. As franchisee, you are responsible for the conduct of your employees and for otherwise exercising day-to-day control over your franchised business.
You also have the responsibility to adhere to the Standards of the System as they now exist and may from time to time be modified, and you acknowledge that at the heart of the System and this franchise relationship is your commitment to that
responsibility. Furthermore, you acknowledge that your commitment is important to us, to you, and to other franchisees in order to promote the goodwill associated with our System and Proprietary Marks, and that this Agreement should be interpreted
to give full effect to this paragraph. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">2.4 (a)&nbsp;Accordingly, for the Term of this Agreement, we grant you the license, and you accept the
obligation, to operate a Restaurant (the “Restaurant”) within our System, using our intellectual property, only in accordance with our Standards and the other terms of this Agreement. This license is non-exclusive and relates solely to the
single Restaurant location set forth in the Contract Data Schedule. We retain the right to operate or license others to operate Baskin-Robbins restaurants and other concepts, and to grant other licenses relating to the Proprietary Marks, at such
locations and on such terms as we choose. We may use or license others to use the Proprietary Marks in ways that compete with your location and that draw customers from the same area as your Restaurant. </font></p>

from time to time. All insurance must be placed and maintained with insurance companies with ratings that meet or exceed our Standards. At our request, you must provide us with proof of required insurance coverages. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">12.1 We and any affiliated party we designate must be named as additional insureds as our respective interests appear, and all policies must contain

insureds. Policies may not be limited in any way by reason of any insurance that we (or any named party) may maintain. Upon our request, you must produce proof that you currently have the insurance coverage described in this Agreement, with all of

effect. When you are obtaining the policies of insurance required by this subsection, you must give notice to your insurance carriers that the above mutual waiver of subrogation is contained in this Agreement. This obligation to maintain insurance
is separate and distinct from your obligation to indemnify us under the provisions of Section&nbsp;14.9. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px" align="center"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2"><b>SECTION 13.

in compliance with our Standards, or if we believe that the sale price of the interest to be conveyed is so high, or the terms of sale so onerous, that it is likely the transferee would be unable to properly operate, maintain, upgrade and promote
the Restaurant and meet all financial and other obligations to us and to third parties. At the time of transfer, you and all of your shareholders, partners and members must execute a general release of us and our parent and affiliates, in our
then-current standard form. If after an approved transfer, a shareholder, member or partner no longer has an interest in the franchised business, then such party is relieved of further obligations to us under the terms of this Agreement, except for

arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or another nationally established arbitration association acceptable to you and us) and under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
The plaintiff’s election to arbitrate or to submit the dispute to the court system, including any compulsory counterclaims, is binding on the parties except that we shall have the option to submit to a court any of the following actions: to
collect fees due under this Agreement; for injunctive relief; to protect our intellectual property, including Proprietary Marks; and to terminate this Agreement for a default. For any arbitration, the arbitrator(s) shall issue a reasoned award, with
findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitration award and the decision on any appeal will be conclusive and binding on the parties. Actions to enforce an express obligation to pay money may be brought under the Expedited Procedures of the
AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration shall be in the state in which the Restaurant is located. The Federal Arbitration Act shall govern, excluding all state arbitration law. Massachusetts’s law shall govern all
other issues. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">15.2 <b>Scope of Arbitration</b>: Disputes concerning the validity or scope of this Section, including whether a dispute is
subject to arbitration, are beyond the authority of the arbitrator(s) and shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 <u>et</u> <u>seq</u>., as amended from time to time. The
provisions of this Section shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to any expiration or termination of this Agreement. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2">15.3
<b>Appeals</b>: Either of us may appeal the final award of the arbitrator(s) to the appropriate U.S. District Court. The Court’s review of the arbitrator’s findings of fact shall be under the clearly erroneous standard, and the
Court’s review of all legal rulings shall be <i>de novo</i>. If it is determined that this provision for federal court review is not enforceable, then either party may appeal the arbitrator’s final award to a panel of three arbitrators
chosen under AAA procedures, employing the same standards of review stated immediately above. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px" align="center"><font style="font-family:Times New Roman" size="2"><b>SECTION 16. MISCELLANEOUS

term of this Agreement, including any extension or renewal, at “triple-net” fair market value rent for comparable Baskin-Robbins locations with arms-length leases. If the parties cannot agree on the fair market value, they will consult a

payments from any person or entity other than you, such payments will be deemed made by such person as your agent and not as your successor or assignee. We may waive or modify any obligation of other franchisees under agreements similar to this
